Hi, I am Leon, 25 years old living and working in Germany. 

Over the last 2 years I worked as a Data Scientist for an online marketing agency and as an ML Engineer for the AI startup Westphalia DataLab in Münster.

At WDL we are currently building a SaaS to help our customers find the right leads at the right time.
The core of our product is a recommendation engine, matching our customers with the right companies.

My work is split between\
🤗 &nbsp;**Building the recommendation engine** around a BERT language model\
🎁 &nbsp;Wrapping everything in **APIs and containers**\
🚀 &nbsp;Pushing the codebase for the SaaS to **production in the cloud**\
🚧 &nbsp;**Maintaining the infrastructure** and integrations with additional modules

Working in a product focused environment pushed my excitement for software infrastructure and cloud deployments through the roof!
Since then I am focused on\
💾 &nbsp;Using **SQL-DBs, NoSQL-DBs and unstructured data storages** appropriately and dynamically with ML models\
🚢 &nbsp;**Shipping models** as early and as stable as possible\
🚨 &nbsp;Having an eye on **changing parameters and performances** of a live model\
💡 &nbsp;Integrating services like **message broker and pod scaling** cleverly in the applications workflow
