Hi, 

I am Leon, a Machine Learning Engineer living and working in Amsterdam. I am 28 years old and have been playing around and building things with tech for over a decade now.

Over the last 3 years I worked as a Data Scientist for an online marketing agency, as an ML Engineer for a german AI startup and currently as an ML Engineer for a food delivery company.
<!--
I lead the development of a core for a SaaS to helping customers find the right leads at the right time.
The core consisted of a recommendation engine, matching our customers with the right companies.

My work is split between\
🤗 &nbsp;**Building the recommendation engine** around a BERT language model\
🎁 &nbsp;Wrapping everything in **APIs and containers**\
🚀 &nbsp;Pushing the codebase for the SaaS to **production in the cloud**\
🚧 &nbsp;**Maintaining the infrastructure** and integrations with additional modules
-->

Working in a product focused environment pushed my excitement for software infrastructure and cloud deployments!  
That's why I am focused on\
💾 &nbsp;Using **SQL-DBs, NoSQL-DBs and unstructured data storages** appropriately and dynamically with ML models\
🚢 &nbsp;**Shipping models** as early and as stable as possible\
🚨 &nbsp;Having an eye on **changing parameters and performances** of a live model\
🚧 &nbsp;**Building and Maintaining infrastructure**\
💡 &nbsp;Integrating services like **message broker and pod scaling** cleverly in the applications design
