Hi, I am Leon, 25 years old living and working in Germany. Over the last 2 years I worked as a Data Scientist for an online marketing agency and as an ML Engineer for the AI startup Westphalia DataLab in Münster.

At the WDL I am currently building a SaaS to help our customers find the right leads at the right time.
The core of our product is a recommendation engine, matching our customers with the right companies.

My work is split between  
🤗 Building the recommendation engine around a BERT language model
🎁 Wrapping everything in APIs and containers
🚀 Pushing the codebase for the SaaS to production
🚧 Maintaining the infrastructure and integrations with additional modules
