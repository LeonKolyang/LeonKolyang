Hi, I am Leon, 25 years old living and working in Germany. 

Over the last 2 years I worked as a Data Scientist for an online marketing agency and as an ML Engineer for the AI startup Westphalia DataLab in Münster.

At WDL we are currently building a SaaS to help our customers find the right leads at the right time.
The core of our product is a recommendation engine, matching our customers with the right companies.

My work is split between  
🤗 Building the recommendation engine around a BERT language model\
🎁 Wrapping everything in APIs and containers\
🚀 Pushing the codebase for the SaaS to production\
🚧 Maintaining the infrastructure and integrations with additional modules\

Working in a product focused environment pushed my excitement for software infrastructure and cloud deployments through the roof.
Since then I have used every opportunity to
💾 Use SQL-DBs, NoSQL-DBs and unstructured data storages appropriately and dynamically with ML models
🚢 Ship models as early and as stable as possible
🚨 Have an eye on changing parameters and performances of a live model
💡 Integrate services like message broker and pod scaling cleverly in the applications workflow
